Welp, the cat's out the bag! I posted my website on Mastodon as a 'soft-launch', expecting my normal audience of 20-30 loyal followers to see it. I certainly didn't expect to hit the explore/trending page on multiple instances and nearly a hundred comments! Thank you so much.

I am honestly incredibly moved by the number of comments from Web Standards folks, browser developers, IndieWeb advocates, and random passerbys who are just nostalgic for the older web. The number of comments I have received from people who I consider my personal idols honestly floors me. I especially treasure the comments from those who have used an accessibility feature or enjoyed the keyboard-only experience, it makes all that extra work worth it.

## My approach to personal sites

This year has been pretty difficult in that I haven't been able to do a lot of work that fully reflects my values. I have always wanted to build things that are cool and awesome without sacrificing the core values of progressive enhancement, performance and accessibility, and I'm glad that 1. that approach still resonates with so many people and 2. that I have somewhat managed to succeed in this goal! The idea to build an OS-themed site is certainly not new, but there aren't a lot of them that don't have a load screen, that work without JavaScript and on mobile-sized screens, so it's been fun trying to solve those challenges.

I'm really glad to have a little space on my own where I get to explore new advancements in core web technologies and finetune my approach to [the craft of making websites](https://gomakethings.com/on-craft-and-the-web/). There are still things I'd like to do with the site, but I'm trying to treat it more like a garden â€” just because things might change and grow over time, it doesn't mean that it isn't beautiful and worth looking at in it's current state.

## Thanks, EJ

I wanted to give a shoutout to my good friend [EJ Mason](https://front-end.social/@codeability) for their unwavering support, and willingness to discuss accessibility issues and look at things in Safari, my worst nemesis. The process of getting this done was spread out over a year, stuffed between busy periods of client work, and I can't thank them enough for being there throughout the process.

## What's next?

One of the reasons I decided to stop tinkering and hit the publish button was effort of maintaining two versions of my blog simultaneously. It was really holding me back from publishing more in a way I didn't initial expect. I have a few drafts in the backlog that I'm excited to share, and I intend to finish up [the series on building this very site](https://www.nicchan.me/blog/building-my-new-website-part-1/), if only to document some of the cool new things we have in CSS that I learned along the way! I hope you'll stick around for the journey!

(PS: I really hope I didn't break anyone's RSS feeds by migrating! Please let me know if I did!)
