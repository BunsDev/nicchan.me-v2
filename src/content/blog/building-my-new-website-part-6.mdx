This is a post in a series about building my new website, check out [the previous post in this series.](/blog/building-my-new-website-part-4/)

## Fonts

It's at this point I start doing some performance testing. One of the key issues was that I had a huge amount of Cumulative Layout Shift as the fonts came in. The font I had chosen, W95FA is pretty narrow compared to other fonts, and I wanted to see if I could minimize the amount of jank as the fonts came in. The layout of my site meant that containers resizing would feel especially choppy. I also knew that I would want to add a toggle between pixel and anti-aliased fonts, as it was a setting I've seen in video games and I knew that some people would find the pixel fonts tiring to read. Switching between the two would need to feel pretty seamless, with as little layout shift as I could manage.

At some point, I had stumbled upon the website [Modern Font Stacks](https://modernfontstacks.com/), which provides a list of font fallbacks by style to cover every OS. I really liked the Humanist font stack, but the question remained on
