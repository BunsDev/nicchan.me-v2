This is a post in a series about building my new website, check out [the previous post in this series.](/blog/building-my-new-website-part-4/)

## Full text RSS

This was really where progress on the site began to stall. At the time I was building this out, Astro had no support for full text RSS out of the box, and there were several [hacks](https://scottwillsey.com/rss-pt1/), [(another hack)](https://piccalil.li/blog/full-text-rss-is-back/) that would let you bypass this, but I really didn't want to bother when I felt like the [Astro Container API](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/container-reference/) was going to happen soon. Luckily, my guess paid off, and Astro released the Container API, which worked without a hitch! Sometimes procrastination pays off!

I did hit a minor snafu in that the [Astro RSS Feed plugin](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss/) only outputs RSS format, not Atom. I wanted to use Atom to leverage the 'Updated' property in my posts, as I occasionally need to make corrections and revisions. Luckily, I was able to switch out the plugin for the framework agnostic [feed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feed) plugin, which is both more flexible and has more features.

I really dislike the trend where every new framework needs to have it's own version of a basic functionality. While there are definitely valid reasons behind the phenonmenon, I feel like it does end up fragmenting the web ecosysytem and gives junior developers the false impression that some things are much more difficult than they actually are.

## Pixels, revisited

While creating new pixel sprites, I noticed that the file sizes were much larger than SVG sizes I have seen in the past. Some of them were over 30KB for a single sprite! This was because my pixel art program, Aseprite, exports [every single pixel as an individual rectangle](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/1911), even if the individual rectangles make up a larger blob of color.

I tried using PNGs while relying on `image-rendering: pixelated`, a technique recently outlined by [Chris Coyier in more detail over at Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/keeping-pixely-images-pixely-and-performant/), but I noticed that at the sizes I was displaying the image, it would sometimes render line-widths inconsistently. After the time I took to hand-pixel everything, there was just no way I was gonna let this slide.

Luckily, I found this [really cool codepen by Shaw](https://codepen.io/shshaw/full/XbxvNj) that converts a raster image into an SVG, so I ended up running everything through there instead. There's a [code version](https://github.com/meyerweb/px2svg) of this library that does this, but since I only have fewer than 10 individual sprites, it would have been overkill to implement.

As a side note, this serves as a gentle reminder to myself to ask for help sometimes. Upon looking at Eric Meyer's library solution, I noticed Amelia Bellamy-Royds was listed as one of the contributors. I practically have Amelia on speed dial for all my tricky SVG questions, had I asked for help I might have saved myself many hours!

Once I had my SVGs, I cobbled together a quick Node script based on this [helpful tutorial by German Makarov](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-create-svg-sprite-with-icons) in order to glue them into a big spritesheet that will allow me to minimize the HTTP requests for the icons. I know there are plugins like [astro-icon](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon) that handle this in a more 'elegant' way, but given that there is a pretty manageable amount of icons, I opted for the path that was much less likely to involve breaking dependency upgrades. Lately, I've been just writing node scripts for various build things if tooling feels too much overhead. I typically only dramatically change my site every 5 years or so, so having a maintainable, low-key solution is really important to me. I've suffered through enough Grunt, Gulp, Snowpack, Webpack and Rollup migrations!

## Build-time generated table of contents

Having a table of contents generated at build wasn't always easy to implement. It's not uncommon to have to resort to client-side JavaScript in order to scrape the rendered content for headings, and this can sometimes be really undesireable due to the potential layout shifts, as Table of Contents are often relatively high up on a page. Astro makes this super easy by providing a list of headings already, and with some finangling with [a snippet from Kevin Drum's tutorial](https://kld.dev/building-table-of-contents/#building-a-nested-table-of-contents-array), I was able to get the headings in a nested format. It only took a little client-side JS to hook up an Intersection Observer to watch the content and highlight the section we're currently on. Rendered HTML with a little sprinkle of JS for extra functionality, just the way I like it!
