title: "Open Source"

I love open-source work, but as a sole freelancer it's especially difficult to find the opportunities to do it when not backed by corporate sponsors! I'm very grateful to those who have allowed me the opportunity to contribute to the wider web ecosystem.

## W3C Maps4HTML Working Group

In 2021, I got the opportunity to work on projects with the Maps4HTML Working Group, most notably, the [Use Cases and Requirements for Standardizing Web Maps Report](https://maps4html.org/HTML-Map-Element-UseCases-Requirements/). It was a great to gain some experience in the tremendous amount of work and effort it takes to bring Web Standards to life. I even got to speak at the [W3C/OGC Joint Workshop](/blog/talk-ui-patterns-in-existing-web-map-widgets/) on web map accessibility!

## A11yProject

I'm a maintainer on the [A11yProject](https://www.a11yproject.com/), where I developed an extensible theming system in order to support [dark mode](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/pull/1433) (and potentially other future color modes) across the site.
