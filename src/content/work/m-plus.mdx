Prior to the museum's launch, I was honored to be selected as a services vendor by the M+ digital team. I worked together with Jarijn Nijkamp on project management and [Jimmy Lam](https://studioearth.co/) on design to complete a variety of projects for the M+ museum. All M+ projects have passed third party accessibility audits to the WCAG AA standard.

## Mainland China microsite

M+ needed a microsite located behind the Chinese firewall with no outside dependencies
in order to ensure that visitors in China could have uninterrupted access to important information. We utilized self-hosted static assets and configurable JSON files to populate content to reduce risk.

		}
	/>

## Digital Signage

M+ wanted to commission a solution for their digital signage to be used around the museum. Initially, I had come up with a solution where the signs used JavaScript on the client-side to fetch new events without reloading the page. During the course of the project, we found out that not only were the signs running a version of Chrome from 2016, the browser environment didn't support any JavaScript at all!

			"Digital signage installed at M+. Horizontal signs for the Learning Hub hanging on the wall. Spread across two signage panels are the next 6 events for the day in 6 columns."

		alt={
			"A vertical digital sign with a pink background and the next six events at the museum."

	/>

Luckily, because I had chosen 11ty as the static site generator, it was completely trivial to move the data-fetching code to the back end. On the front end, we used an even simpler technique, setting the [meta refresh header](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H76.html), to make sure the signs refreshed at regular intervals.

The signs also supported configurations for horizontal and vertical layouts, color theming and conditional images. I'm proud to say that the M+ team has had no difficulty maintaining the solution on their own - nothing gives me greater joy that a team being able to pick up a solution and maintain it without any friction at all!

## Static HTML and CSS

I also built out several HTML/CSS/JS templates for other vendors to
incorporate additional functionality into, including a queueing system and
the Wi-Fi landing pages for the museum.
