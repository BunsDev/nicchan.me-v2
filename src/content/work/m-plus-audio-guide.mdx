M+ had an existing audio guide vendor that specialized in providing audio guide software and devices for the museum to load. However, this vendor's technical approach involved loading every single audio guide asset up front, for a total payload of 1GB+, an action that often took over 10 minutes on museum Wi-Fi. M+ knew they wanted to offer visitors the choice to use their own devices and that the current loading speed was unnacceptable, so I desgined a new technical architecture for them that would better support their goals.

## Design

In the process of building the audio guide, we utilized M+'s user testing results from the previous version of the audio guide to drive the design process. We knew the local audience was extremely familiar with QR codes, but we also utilized the keypad strategy for greater accessibility, as Braile numbers can be included next to each exhibit object next to the QR code.

Upon visiting the museum after the audio guide's launch, I was happy to see a diverse audience of visitors using the various different strategies for the app without requiring additional assistance.

## Technical details

The M+ Audio Guide PWA has two use cases, and required two modes: one for visitors who are using their own phones, and one for devices that were to be loaned out by the museum. Both architectures use the same core, an 11ty powered static site that drew data from the museum's own API. This had the added bonus of migrating off the previous solution of having a completely separate CMS where data would be duplicated.

The static HTML files had their functionality enhanced with Petite Vue, a framework that was chosen for it's lightness and because the in-house development team at the museum was familiar with it.

These pages and assets were cached by seperate service workers depending on the mode the PWA was in. For the bring-your-own-device mode, we cached the core pages and files immediately once a language was selected, and load the audio files as needed, with a little bit of intelligent guesswork based on the user's previous usage of the app. For the museum device mode, we load everything, while providing the desk operators a way to check for updates and invalidate the cache as new content is found.

## Credits

I worked together with Jarijn Nijkamp on project management and [Jimmy Lam](https://studioearth.co/) on design to complete this project for the M+ Digital Team. The audio guide passed a external WCAG AA audit by the Hong Kong Blind Union.
