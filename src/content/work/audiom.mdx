Web maps as a whole are not really accessible. Maps as a medium are inherently spatial, and until now, we haven't quite figured out how to translate spatial information to blind users using web technologies. Audiom borrows from interaction patterns pioneered in video games to make web maps finally accessible to all. Users can browse any location on earth using OpenStreetMap data, or upload their own GeoJSON. The map viewwer supports standard spatial maps for navigating geolocated and non-geolocated data as well as chloropleth/thematic maps.

As the only sighted developer and WCAG expert on a team full of blind developers, I was in charge of several key aspects of Audiom. I moved the project off of Material UI and other inaccessible visual libraries, I worked on full WCAG AAA compliance across all aspects of the application, and I designed and developed the visual UI, writing most components from scratch in React.
