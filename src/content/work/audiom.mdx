Web maps as a whole are not really accessible. Maps as a medium are inherently spatial, and until now, we haven't quite figured out how to translate spatial information to blind users using **web technologies**.

Audiom borrows from interaction patterns pioneered in video games to make web maps finally accessible to all. Users can browse any location on earth using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data, or upload their own GeoJSON. The map viewer supports standard spatial maps for navigating geolocated and non-geolocated data as well as chloropleth/thematic maps.

As the only sighted developer and WCAG expert on a team full of blind developers, I was in charge of several key aspects of Audiom. I moved the project off of Material UI and other inaccessible visual libraries, I worked on full WCAG AAA compliance across all aspects of the application, and I designed and developed the visual UI, writing most components from scratch in React.

I also worked on other key features of the application, including making the editing experience accessible, adding a speech log, building the geolocation, user settings and routing modules.

I utilized best practice color schemes for maximum contrast and chose patterns to carefully create a logical order in terms of pattern density. Patterns and colors are individually toggleable, amongst many other granular settings.
