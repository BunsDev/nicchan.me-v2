<h3>Baseline</h3>
<p>
	Baseline is a type-focused, brutalist style theme, with nearly infinite ways
	to configure. Baseline takes it to the next level with configurable options
	for spacing, grids and offsets, making it one of the most customizable themes
	in the theme store.

	<p class="testimonial__text">
		Hands down one of the handiest, easiest, well-coded and most versatile
		Themes I have worked with. The settings are rich of options, the Theme
		allows for a lot of customisation, and even their helpdesk is fast and
		friendly. 100% would recommend!
