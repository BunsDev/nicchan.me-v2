From 2021 to 2023, I worked on three of Switch's premier Shopify themes. I developed core components for the Baseline, Label and Shapes themes, as well as provided accessibility consultation for all of Switch's themes. All of the projects utilized Alpine.JS and Tailwind CSS, and I developed several pieces of custom tooling in order expedite the theme building process and improve internal processes.

## Baseline

Baseline is a type-focused, brutalist style theme, with nearly infinite option
for configuration. Baseline takes it to the next level with settings
for spacing, grids and offsets, making it one of the most customizable themes
in the theme store.

		alt={
			"A page informing the user that they are now online and a link to the current events, a map, the ticket link and the cinema."
		}
		label="Bold"
	/>
</WorkImageContainer>

> Hands down one of the handiest, easiest, well-coded and most versatile Themes I have worked with. The settings are rich of options, the Theme	allows for a lot of customisation, and even their helpdesk is fast and 	friendly. 100% would recommend!

## Shapes

Shapes is a playful theme with vibrant colors, customizeable stickers, fun animations, and you guessed it, shapes. Special care was taken to make all animateable elements respect user's motion preferences.

## Label
Label is a theme designed for large catalogs with a lot of related products, such as books and music. It features unique components such as an audio player and track list to support this functionality.
