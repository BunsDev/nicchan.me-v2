WebPageTest is one of the most essential tools in a web developer's toolkit, as it is the go-to resource for doing any kind of performance testing. I was proud to have been entrusted to build the blog for WebPageTest, which needed very little tweaking from their inhouse team of performance experts.

Being a blog for web developers, we got to use all the latest hot tech tips ðŸ”¥ for improving performance. Amongst other things, the WebPageTest blog uses responsive images powered by Cloudinary,with fixed aspect ratios for a jank-free loading experience and perfect CLS score,
paginated categories, tags and authors (a feature not present in 11ty by default).

			"A WebPageTest blog post, with a title, author, social share links, a big hero image and content below it."

The blog has since been merged into the CatchPoint blog, but it remains one of my career highlights.
