I am committed to ensuring digital accessibility for disbled users. While this website has not undergone a formal evaluation under WCAG 2.2, I strive for [level AA conformance under the Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).

## Measures to Support Accessibility

- keyboard only usage
- screen readers, specifically NVDA and Chrome
