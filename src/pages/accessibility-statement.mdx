I am committed to ensuring digital accessibility for disbled users. While this website has not undergone a formal evaluation under WCAG 2.2, I strive for [level AA conformance under the Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).

## Measures to Support Accessibility

All features of this website are expected to work in modern browsers (latest 2 versions), and are tested with the following:

- automatic testing tools including [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) and [axe DevTools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd)
- keyboard only usage
- screen readers, specifically NVDA and Chrome

## Known issues
Below is a list of currently known issues:
- Not all pages have multiple ways to access them (2.4.5: Multiple Ways (Level AA))
- The mousedown event is used to fix a bug with post heading anchor links causing the whole page to scroll out of view (2.5.2: Pointer Cancellation (Level A))
- Some pages on this site have headings that cause the page to have horizontal scrollbars at 320px (1.4.10:
Reflow (Level AA))

## Feedback

I welcome any feedback on the accessibility of my website. Please let me know if you encounter accessibility barriers through the website [contact](/contact/) form, or by emailing me directly at [nic@nicchan.me](mailto:nicchan.me).
